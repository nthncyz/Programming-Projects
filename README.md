## 🔹 **Core Programming Skills**  

- 🛠 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
- 🗂 **Data Structures & Algorithms** – Arrays, linked lists, stacks, sorting/searching techniques  
- 🔢 **Mathematical & Logical Computation** – Numerical analysis, bitwise operations  
- ⚡ **Concurrency & Multithreading** – Parallel execution, thread synchronization  
- 📝 **File Handling & I/O Streams** – `fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream` for structured data management  
- 🧠 **Memory Management** – Dynamic allocation, pointer arithmetic, RAII principles  
- 🚀 **Optimization Techniques** – Compiler flags, profiling, performance tuning  
- 🔍 **Error Handling & Debugging** – Exception handling, debugging using GDB

## 🔹 **Development & Tooling**  

Each project is compiled and tested using `g++`, incorporating:  

- ✅ **Version Control (Git)** – Branching strategies, commit structuring, repository management  
- 🔄 **Build Automation** – Makefiles, shell scripting for streamlined compilation workflows  
- 🏗 **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Writing portable code for Linux, macOS, and Windows  
- 📜 **Software Engineering Best Practices** – Modular design, clean code, and documentation standards
