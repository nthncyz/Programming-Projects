# 🎯 My C++ University Projects - 2024 - 2025

🚧 Ongoing Updates
This repository will be continuously updated throughout the year with new C++ projects as I progress through my coursework. Stay tuned for more additions! 

I created this repository to showcase a collection of my **C++ projects** developed for my university coursework, demonstrating proficiency in **fundamental and advanced programming concepts**.

## 🔹 **Core Programming Skills**  

- 🛠 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
- 🗂 **Data Structures & Algorithms** – Arrays, linked lists, stacks, sorting/searching techniques  
- 🔢 **Mathematical & Logical Computation** – Numerical analysis, bitwise operations  
- ⚡ **Concurrency & Multithreading** – Parallel execution, thread synchronization  
- 📝 **File Handling & I/O Streams** – `fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream` for structured data management  
- 🧠 **Memory Management** – Dynamic allocation, pointer arithmetic, RAII principles  
- 🚀 **Optimization Techniques** – Compiler flags, profiling, performance tuning  
- 🔍 **Error Handling & Debugging** – Exception handling, debugging using GDB

## 🔹 **Development & Tooling**  

Each project is compiled and tested using `g++`, incorporating:  

- ✅ **Version Control (Git)** – Branching strategies, commit structuring, repository management  
- 🔄 **Build Automation** – Makefiles, shell scripting for streamlined compilation workflows  
- 🏗 **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Writing portable code for Linux, macOS, and Windows  
- 📜 **Software Engineering Best Practices** – Modular design, clean code, and documentation standards

This repository serves as a **hands-on exploration of C++ software development**, integrating both foundational and **industry-relevant programming techniques**.  

## 📌 Project Summaries  

- **Profit Doubling Calculator** - A C++ program that calculates a company's profit over four years, doubling each year, and outputs the results in a formatted statement.  
- **Time Conversion Tool** - Converts a user-inputted number of days into hours, minutes, and seconds using predefined constants for time units.  
- **Store Receipt Generator** - Simulates a store receipt by calculating the subtotal, tax, and total cost for five predefined items, ensuring accurate formatting.  
- **Circle Area Calculator** - Takes user input for a circle’s radius and calculates its area, displaying the result with two decimal places.  
- **Squares in a Circle Calculator** - Determines how many squares can fit inside a circle by comparing their areas, ensuring precise calculations and formatted output.  
- **Rectangle Area Calculator** - Computes and displays the area of a rectangle based on user-provided length and width measurements.  
- **Event Planner Application** - Collects user details about an event and generates a structured summary, including event type, location, guest count, theme, and key guests.
